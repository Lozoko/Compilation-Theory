# Final project for compilation theory

This repository shows the results of work for 5 laboratory sessions for a compilation theory subject. Each subsequent session resulted in creating another module or
developing existing one. At first, we wrote a simple lexical scanner, then we added a parser and an interpreter

The project is based on PLY and written in Python
